            <h1>Raktarpan at IIT Kanpur</h1>
            <div className="about-content">
                <p>Raktarpan is a student-led initiative under the National Service Scheme (NSS) and part of the Community Welfare Cell (CWC) of Students‚Äô Gymkhana, IIT Kanpur. Founded in 2014 by Himanshu Agarwal, Raktarpan was launched to address the critical challenge of blood shortage in Kanpur and nearby regions.
</p>
                <p>As blood cannot be manufactured and depends entirely on voluntary donations, Raktarpan serves as a vital link between generous donors and patients in urgent need. Over the years, it has grown into a youth-driven movement that offers free and timely assistance, especially to the underprivileged. The name ‚ÄúRaktarpan‚Äù combines Rakt (blood) and Arpan (offering), reflecting its mission of selfless service and life-saving¬†contribution.</p>
                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p>To create awareness about blood donation, ensure a sustainable supply of blood for those in need within the IITK community and surrounding areas, and foster a culture of social responsibility among students, faculty, and staff.</p>
                
                <h2>Our Vision</h2>
                <p>To create a society where no life is lost due to the unavailability of blood, by fostering a culture of voluntary blood donation and selfless¬†service.</p>
